## ðŸ“š TL;DR

My personal portfolio features some of my Github projects highlighting the most relevant skills and technologies they were built with. Not only that, but a tiny resume and some ways to contact me! You can fork this repo and make the changes you want by giving the proper credits.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
|   |â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   |â”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ clock.svg
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       ...
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ boxing.webp
â”‚   â”‚           ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   |â”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                       |
