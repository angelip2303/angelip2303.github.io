During my first work experience, I had the exciting opportunity to intern as an Academy Data Engineer at Empathy.co. As part of the team, I was fully immersed in the world of Big Data, working with cutting-edge technologies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Scala, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud. This invaluable hands-on experience allowed me to gain practical insights into the world of data engineering and analytics.

Located in Gij√≥n, Principado de Asturias, Spain, Empathy.co provided a dynamic and innovative environment where I collaborated with talented professionals in the field. Throughout my time as an intern, I actively contributed to various projects and had the chance to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios.

This experience not only deepened my technical expertise but also instilled in me the value of teamwork and effective communication in achieving successful outcomes. I am grateful for the knowledge and skills I acquired during this internship, setting a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the exciting world of data engineering and beyond.
